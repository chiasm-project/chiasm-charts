# chiasm-charts

Reusable data visualization components for [Chiasm](https://github.com/chiasm-project/chiasm).

The beginnings of this library are explained in this [video tutorial: Introduction to Chiasm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpweS7gNBt4). This video tutorial ends with this [code example: Reactive Mixins for Visualizations](http://bl.ocks.org/curran/5e3c1bed7c9cdd2b431c).

## Developing

To get set up with your development, clone this repository and install dependencies with these commands.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:chiasm-project/chiasm-charts.git
cd chiasm-charts
npm install
```

After that, you can run the visual tests with the command:

```
npm run build
```

This will build the test application, which you can then inspect in a browser window open to the visual test page. This serves as the unit test suite for chiasm-charts.
